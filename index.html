Seattle places to eat:

The Shambles

- Maple Leaf’s restaurant/butcher shop/bar hybrid is one of the more underrated gems in the city. During the pandemic, it has shifted heavily to retail with its high-quality meat selections, available in “butcher boxes” that are locally sourced. There are rabbits from Spokane, ducks from Grays Harbor County, and steaks a-plenty, but the prepared food also holds up well for takeout, and there are potent, well-crafted cocktails to go.

There are also pandan lattes and durian white chocolate mochas, best paired with the cafe’s famed bright purple ube cheesecake.

Maneki:

- Seattle’s oldest sushi bar has been open since 1904, but remains as resilient as ever. In a sign of the times, the restaurant is offering online takeout orders for the first time on its large menu of sushi rolls, udon, and sukiyaki dishes. And though it’s a shame that the intimate dine-in experience is temporarily not an option, Maneki in any form is a treat.
